## Legend

**Stage & Weeks**: The curriculum is organized into three stages, with each stage spanning 4 weeks. The first two stages consist of individual projects, while the final stage is dedicated to team-based capstone work.

**Project**: The mission and stakes of each project \- what students are trying to achieve, who it impacts, and why it matters. This sets the context and motivation for both the rebuild and AI enhancements.

**Deliverables**: Required project milestones and outputs that demonstrate mastery of both development and AI capabilities.

**Key AI Skills**: Core AI engineering competencies that students will develop through implementing the enhancements. These skills build progressively throughout the curriculum.

**Target App**: The established application that students will use as a foundation for their rebuild. Students recreate core functionalities of these popular apps to demonstrate fundamental engineering capabilities.

**Rebuild Success Criteria**: Specific, measurable requirements that students must meet to demonstrate they have successfully rebuilt the core functionality of the target app. These criteria ensure technical competency and feature completeness.

**AI Enhancements**: Novel AI features that students will integrate into their rebuilt application, extending beyond the target app's original functionality.

**Success Metrics**: A combination of: Technical metrics: How well the AI performs its intended function (accuracy, speed, reliability), user adoption metrics: Active users, engagement rates, viral coefficients, and developer community impact: GitHub stars, forks, community contributions
